### Hello there 👋🏼

I'm a Software Engineer since 2019 and currently studying a Master in Web Engineering in the University of Oviedo. In the meantime, I'm working with the [WESO Research Group](http://www.weso.es/).

I like programming in any languaje, but I particularly enjoy programming for the web and creating videogames in Unity and C# (👉🏼 https://ulitol97.itch.io/)
